(The weird warning on the second line is just a quirk of a recent update to the
iTunes application. It’s harmless and might be resolved by Apple in a future
release of iTunes. If you’re curious, you can read more about this warning
message here.)

itunes-command is also useful for controlling iTunes remotely over a ssh
session.
